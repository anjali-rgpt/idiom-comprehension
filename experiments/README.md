In the experiments folder, we define the setup of our experiment in a web-based setting. The experiment.html file contains the web-page interface that participants will interact with over the course of the experiment. The js folder contains file with relevant trial data and functionality that is used to collect user-reported data or their interactions with the interface for further analysis.
